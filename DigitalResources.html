            <p class="ebook">You can also take a look at our “bestsellers” (books that our often borrowed). Since these books are not always available, borrowing a digital version would be a better option if you do not want to wait for the book to be returned. 

                <br><br>You can also get information about our library and the events we will organize from the information boards in our library, and you can contact us for detailed information.
