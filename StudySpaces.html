        <article class="Study">
            <p class="StudySpaces">Our library offers many individual study spaces where you can study on desks in the main study hall. Turn left after the entrance and you will see the area that you are looking for. There are extra rooms available in the second floor and the third floor.<br> <br> <br>Keep in mind that you can only “reserve” spaces by leaving your belongings including your bag, jacket etc. on the desks. Quiet zones require as little noise as possible and foods or drinks are not allowed. Students from any university can study in the lecture hall therefore no Identification is required. We suggest to come early in the morning to get desks that have a power outlet. </p>
