                Our library offers many group study spaces where you can study.You can book group rooms for a maximum of 2 hours. You should sign up with your inholland student mail and choose an available room. Turn right after the entrance and you will see plenty of rooms that you are looking for.
            
                <br> <br>Warning: please leave the study rooms the way you find them. The misuse of study rooms will lead to the ban of group studies. To prevent this, all students must leave the room tidy and are required to respect other students as well. These rooms are only available for Inholland students, therefore a login from another University will not be successful.</p>
